# SignLanguageToSpeech
###### By: Sam Kriegsman, Kayla Wong, & Varun Mehrotra

We are making this project for the PennApps Fall 2018 Hackathon. For someone who is deaf, sign language is much faster than writing or speaking, this project will give a voice to their sign language allowing them to sign and be heard by those who dont know sign language. Our hope is that this project could one day better the lives of people who use sign language.

### The Design:
We will make an android app in Android Studio that uses OpenCV for image recognition. The user will prop the phone up on a stand so it faces them. They will then sign twards the selfie camera and the recognised signs will appear on the screen so they know it is being correctly translated. Then the phone will read out the translated words to the person they are talking to.

### Software:
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) used to develop the android app
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/platforms/android/) used for image recognition, and is supported in Android Studio

### Limitations:
- Needs a phone stand so the camera can face them while keeping both hands free to sign
