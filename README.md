# SignLanguageToSpeech
###### By: Sam Kriegsman, Kayla Wong, & Varun Mehrotra

We are making this project for the PennApps Fall 2018 Hackathon. It could be useful to people who are deaf and want to communicate with someone who doesn't know sign language. Our hope is that this project could one day better the lives of people who use sign language.

### The Design:
Overall design, a raspberry pi with a camera module and screen on one side facing the user. There will be a speaker on the other side facing the other person. The user will begin signing and the recognised letter/words will be shown on the screen so they know it is correctly recognising it. The device will also speak out the signs from the speaker on the back.

### Hardware:
- [Raspberry Pi 3 - Model B+](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3775?src=raspberrypi)
- [Raspberry Pi Camera Module](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3099?src=raspberrypi)
- [Raspberry Pi Screen](https://www.amazon.com/UCTRONICS-Display-Touch-Screen-Raspberry/dp/B076M399XX)
- [Small Speakers](https://www.amazon.com/Speaker-Computer-Powered-Multimedia-Notebook/dp/B075M7FHM1)
- Custom 3D Printed Case

### Software:
- Tensor Flow used for image recognition
- 

### Limitations:
- The device needs to be plugged into a battery pack or an outlet to work
- There is no volume control
- There is no On/Off switch ( you have to unplug it)
