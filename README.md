# SignLanguageToSpeech
###### By: Sam Kriegsman, Kayla Wong, & Varun Mehrotra

### The Design:
Overall design, a raspberry pi with a camera module and screen on one side facing the user. There will be a speaker on the other side facing the other person. The user will begin signing and the recognised letter/words will be shown on the screen so they know it is correctly recognising it. The device will also speak out the signs from the speaker on the back.
